                            My computer science career began in 2018 when I entered my high school's Science Research Program. Having an interest in 
                            video game development, I decided to make it my topic of study. I spent a lot of time reading research articles on video games 
                            and their impact on society. I learned about the process of video game development, and created two video games to present 
                            at the end of the year symposium. I enjoyed the video game development process, but I wasn't sure if I wanted to pursue it as 
                            a profession. In the fall of 2020, I attended SUNY Stony Brook University as a declared Physics major, but two years later, I 
                            realized that my true passion lay in programming. After some consideration, I decided to transfer to CUNY Queens College for 
                            the Fall 2022 semester, where I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Physics.

                            In March 2024, I began my first internship as an Engineering Intern at Vyir Tech, a high-tech startup that operates in the
                            field of infrared cameras. In this role, I worked on the development of an automated data collection system, including wireless
                            communication with mechanical optics devices as well as the creation of a GUI to operate the system with. My work over three
                            months resulted in system that reduced experiment times by approximately 96%.

                        <p>
                            Aside from programming, my biggest passion is baseball. I have been a New York Mets fan ever since I knew what baseball was, 
                            and I am honored to currently work in their Guest Services department as a Fan Greeter. My dream is to bring my
                            programming talents to the organization and contribute to the Mets winning a World Series.
